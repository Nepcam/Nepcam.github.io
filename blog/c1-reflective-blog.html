    <h1>My Reflections</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
            <p>Early days its all new. Learning new jargon, software etc. Talking to people I have never met yet. I think the support from the EDA staff is primo.</p>
            <li>What are your impressions?</li>
            <p>I am excited at this opportunity to develop professionally.</p>
            <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
            <p>I see myself fitting in well within the team. Excited to meet new people. And getting down in the coal-face and working hard alongside my fellow cohorts</p>
            <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
            <p>My initial expectation was that I am about to be challenged on all levels. This hasn't changed. And now I welcome it because thats how I am going to develop.</p>
            <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
            <p>Very excited and yes, I am naturally nervous, because its uncharted territory. I wonder if I am going to handle the pressure?</p>
