    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</li>
            <p>Meditation - Practice to focus and being aware of when my mind drifts off task.</p>
            <p>I am a dreamy type of person (confession), so taking note whilst in a productive situation of when my mind drifts is what I am trying at this stage. So once I hit Boot Camp, hopefully I am ready.</p>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique - I like the timer thing. I have experienced this through Toggl Time Tracker. </p>
            <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique, because I can use the timer to track my focus habits. Although, early days, I haven't really given it a decent chance. I will come back to this blog and make an update as to how I am going.</p>
            <li>What worked for you?</li>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique, although I haven't really mastered it, I feel it will work well for me.</p>
            <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
            <p>I'm going to stick with Meditaion and The Pomodoro Technique. But do more research into other Time and Habit tools.</p>
