      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> What learnings did you take from the chapter? </li>
            <p> In the heat of the moment, how you would normally react, you pause for a split second, and that pause gives you choice. I took this away. The old count to ten method when you are angry. Same type of tool you can use in those trying times where tempers may soar.</p>
            <li> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </li>
            <p>Deep calmness, to remain calm in a trying situation. The ultimate goal, in my opinion. I liked the "listen to yourself breath" method, switching to 'Easy'.</p>
