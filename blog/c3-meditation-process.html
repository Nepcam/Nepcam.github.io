      <h1>Meditation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
                </li>
                <p>I didn't actually have thoughts about meditation.</p>
            <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?
                </li>
                <p>I didn't realise that its just mental training. What stands out for me is the fact that meditaion can help with focus as well as to help you to relax.</p>
            <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
                </li>
                <p>Yes, follow my breath. Practicing to hold my attention on my breathing, and taking note on bringing my focus back to my brething whenever my mind drifts.</p>
        </ul>
