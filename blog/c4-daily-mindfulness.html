      <h1>DAILY MINDFULNESS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
                </li>
                <p>This is a practice that I have implemented within my family. I have not tried it in the workplace or in a social setting, that I am aware of, meaning I may have done it without my knowing I have.</p>
            <li> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                </li>
                <p>Firstly, mindful listening, I'd like to give my full moment-to-moment attention to another person without a judgmental mind, and practice brining my mind back into focus if it wonders. Also, I'd like to practice my mindful conversation skills making sure I adopt the three parts listening, looping and dipping.</p>
            <li>Any other musings?
                </li>
                <p>Yes I am keen to get into meditation a lot more. Keen to try walking meditation.</p>
        </ul>
