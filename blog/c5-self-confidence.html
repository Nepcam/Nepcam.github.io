                What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
            </li>
            <p>Essentially mindfulness and self awareness are the same thing. If mindfulness is a skill you can learn, then self awareness is also the same. </p>
            <li>
                Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
            </li>
            <p>Reading this chapter was quite long i thought, and so felt a bit tired when I tried the Body scan, however felt actually good in some weird way! </p>
            <li>
                What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
            </li>
            <p>This section is a revelation for me. It will take some practice to really get this reality. </p>

      </ul>
