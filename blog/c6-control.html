    <h1>CONTROL</h1>
      <h2>TRIGGERS</h2>
      <p>When I am programming, one of my triggers that causes a disproportionate emotional response, is not having enough time to actually do these sprints. My time is governed by work and family, also feeling too tired to do some coding after a days hard yakka in the bush. </p>

      <P>I noticed that when using Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond) I used step1.Stop, pretty well, by doing nothing at all. From there I am able to recognise where I need to focus my time habits, or plan my next coding session. </P>
