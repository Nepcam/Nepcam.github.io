    <h1><strong>SELF MOTIVATION</strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></h2>
    
    <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
      <p>My core value is family based being a solo father of three sons, where leadership plays an important part to demonstrate to my children that you can get back on your feet from being down.
        </p>
    <h2>What do you stand for?</h2>
      <p>Family first - get this part correct and then go forth 
        </p>
    <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
      <p>Would have been great to have these ideas during the time I am actually going through personal obstacles so I can use them effectively. But good to know these tools are available. As for the meditation exercise, I have been lazy in implementing them, I focus soley on work and getting through phase-0.
