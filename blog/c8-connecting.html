    <h2>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? </h2>
    <p>No, I wasn't aware of this technique or that it exists. However, I understand how important it is after reading the chapter</p>

    <h2>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2>
      <p>I didn't have the opportunity to try this, as I am now out of work I didn't want to try this on my family. But I have developed my mindful conversation understanding and skills by using them in the  workplace in colleagues in pressure situations.  </p>

    <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
      <p> Beautiful. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this.

    <h2>The political awareness exercise</h2>
    <h3>The Situation</h3>
    
    <p>Recently, there was conflict regarding work around the way management was treating our crew. Pushing us for more production, and placing us in a dangerous situation</p>
    
    <h3>My Point of View</h3>
    
    <p> I felt that my crew manager wasn't listening to our concerns or even letting management know and basically did nothing. So I approached this person about it.  </p>
    
    <h3>Their point of view</h3>
    
    <p>Our crew manager basically thought that we should just do the work, even though management have been wrong and harsh towards our crew. The crew manager took what management pushed on the chin.  </p>
