    <h1><strong>LEADERSHIP</strong></h1>
    <h2>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
        </h2>
    <p> 
        In my experience, it is having a leader who knows what we are going through, because they have been in the same situation, and came through.

    <h2>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
        </h2>
    <p> 
        I enjoyed it. Personally I am wired up to think broadly, to put others before myself. I am out of the workplace at the moment so I couldn't try this out and provide true data.

    <h2>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
        </h2>
    <p>
        Willingness is the keyword here in my opinion. In order to be happy you have to be compassionate. And to be compassionate you have to be willing to recieve the suffering and pain of others, and give relief, well-being, and peace in return. And then experience the ability to be transformers. But as I said in my opening sentence, you have to be willing to do this. It will not work if you are superficial, going for personal gains.

    <h2>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        </h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
       <li>Status = Measured against my former self, awesome. I actually feel elevated coming through Phase 0. </li>
       <li>Ceretainty = There is an element of uncertainty, in terms of if I am actually prepared enough for bootcamp.
           </li>           
       <li>Autonomy = Exerting control over ones environment? Things out of my control have hindered my phase 0 experience. 
        </li>
       <li>Relatedness = Through check-ins, i feel we have a diverse cohort. To me I believe this makes it awesome to bring people together from all walks of life, a place them in pressure situations. I reckon our uniqueness will triumph over pressure.
        </li>
       <li>Fairness = My experience of this has been through our kaiako Harrison & Kelly, Kaiāwhina Māori Dougal, and Jack the bretha.   
        </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? 
        </h2>
    <p>Oh ok, just start a difficult conversation? Hmmm, yep, well me being in a state of mindfullness, I was able to control my emotions. But on the other hand, I was able to keep the other person in check as well.
