      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

            <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li>
            <p>HTML, for example, is like the foundation and the framing of a house. CSS is like the tiling, wallpaper and painting of the house. DOM can be described as the plumbing and electricity.</p>
            <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
            <p>This concept is designing the outlook of the webpage.</p>
            <li>What is the box model?</li>
            <p>The term box model in web development is used when describing layout and design.</p>
