      Notice that we have three stylesheet links: the first two are for the Skeleton framework,
      and the final one is for any custom styles we might need, like turning the background
      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

        <ul>
            <li>What is grid based design?</li>
            <p>Its a web design tool to structure content</p>
            <li>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
            <p>I think the hype here is having companies don't have to worry about creating separate links for bith their desktop/laptop computers and for there mobile sites.</p>
            <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
            <p>Semantic structure is basically a description of the intended meaning of natural language.</p>
            <li>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</li>
            <p>Nothing really to reflect on. And thats because I did the Udacity tutorial a couple of days ago. Because yesterday I had a break from my homework. And doing this today, I am a little bit blank on what I have done previously. Working full-time is difficult especailly a physically demanding job.</p>
