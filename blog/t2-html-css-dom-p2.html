        <ul>
            <li>What is grid based design?</li>
            <p>Its a web design tool to structure content</p>
            <li>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</li>
            <p>I think the hype here is having companies don't have to worry about creating separate links for bith their desktop/laptop computers and for there mobile sites.</p>
            <li>What is semantic structure?</li>
            <p>Semantic structure is basically a description of the intended meaning of natural language.</p>
            <li>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</li>
            <p>Nothing really to reflect on. And thats because I did the Udacity tutorial a couple of days ago. Because yesterday I had a break from my homework. And doing this today, I am a little bit blank on what I have done previously. Working full-time is difficult especailly a physically demanding job.</p>
