        <!--What was the problem? What problem solving techniques did you use?

            I was blocked during the exercise 5.3 Altering the DOM. 
            Where the challenge was to make a element, that was set to 'invisible' to visible.
            Using the developers tools on chrome, syntext errors, I was able to see which part of the code was wrong.
            What I learnt was a new technique that I can use to narrow down where I am going wrong.
