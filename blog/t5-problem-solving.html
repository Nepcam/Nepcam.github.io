        <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>

        <h2><strong>BLOCKED & HOW I MANAGED TO CLEAR THE BLOCKAGE</strong></h2>
        <!--What was the problem? What problem solving techniques did you use?
        How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn?-->
        <p>
            
            I was blocked during the exercise 5.3 Altering the DOM. 
            Where the challenge was to make a element, that was set to 'invisible' to visible.
            Using the developers tools on chrome, syntext errors, I was able to see which part of the code was wrong.
            What I learnt was a new technique that I can use to narrow down where I am going wrong.

        <h2><stong>PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES</stong></h2>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>I understand how this is used as a draft to set out how the program will run. But in terms of using the technique with confidence, I believe will assist in my development personally. </p>
        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>I am not too bad bad at being a tutu!! So I don't mind trying out something.</p>
        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>Explaining my code to a rubber duck? Yeah nah, ok I would definately try this technique out. Actually I need to start reading code more often. </p>
        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>I am ok with reading error messages now that I understand some of the terms used.</p>
        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>Not too sure about this method at this stage but no doubt I will soon</p>
        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>Yes I use uncle google</p>
        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>I have had massive awhi from my fellow peers and extended peers.</p>
        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>Yes I don't mind asking my coaches for help.</p>
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>I am enjoying this process of reflection. Something we didn't do in my other tertiary studies.</p>
