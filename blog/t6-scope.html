    <h1><strong>SCOPE</strong></h1>
    <h2>What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.
        </h2>
    <p>In Javascript 'scope' refers to boundaries within variables. They are â€“ global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Local scope can only be accessed within the function between the curly braces and will only excute from within this function. </p>
